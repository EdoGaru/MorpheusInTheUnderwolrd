-SCREENS
    >(REMEMBER DONT INHERIT FROM GameScreen class directly, look at "Screens/MenuScreens" for example)
	 This is if you plan to have a ContenManager for this Screen without unloading the GLOBAL ContentManager
	 Which i highly recommend doing this way.

	>To choose a name for the Content Manager of a child Screen class, you use [fileName]Content.

	*All the screens need to implement the method UnloadContent.
